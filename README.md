# VK_Saver_Desktop

Someday i decided to copy all of my saved photos in VK to my phone and PC. Well, i decided to use <a href = "https://vknet.github.io/vk/">VkNet API</a> and WinForms to create a desktop application that will allow you to save all of your photos in some album as you choose. Now you can save photos of other users.
- it is not async
- UI is crap
- code is not that good as i want it to be


BUT

wait a little while, im doing IT!
